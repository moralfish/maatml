"""Shared test fixtures.

Registries are process-global, so a test that registers a plugin (or calls
``discover_plugins(force=True)``) would otherwise leak into every test that
runs after it. The autouse fixture snapshots and restores them through the
public registry API, so tests never reach into ``_entries``.
