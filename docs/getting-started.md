# Get started in 5 minutes

The fastest path from a clean checkout to a served model uses
[support-ticket-triage](examples/support-ticket-triage.md): a LoRA fine-tune of
Qwen3-0.6B that turns a raw support ticket into `{priority, category, team,
summary}` JSON. Everything below runs on CPU.

## 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moralfish/maatml.git
cd maatml
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "maatml[ml]"
```

`[ml]` pulls in the training stack (`torch`, `transformers`, `peft`, …). If you
only need the CLI and library, no training, `pip install maatml` is enough.

## 2. Build the train / val / test splits

```bash
maatml prepare examples/support-ticket-triage/
```

This reads the seed data already committed at
`datasets/samples/seed_samples.jsonl` and writes
`output/prepared/{train,val,test}.jsonl` under the model folder. Nothing is
downloaded yet.

## 3. Smoke-train the pipeline

```bash
maatml train examples/support-ticket-triage/ --smoke
```

`--smoke` runs a couple of steps on a slice of data so you can confirm the
tokenizer, base model, LoRA adapter, and trainer all wire up correctly before
spending real compute. This step downloads the base model
(`Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`, ~1.2 GB) from the Hugging Face Hub on first run.

## 4. Train the example as configured

```bash
maatml train examples/support-ticket-triage/
```

Checkpoints land under `output/checkpoints/<run_id>/`. List every run with
`maatml runs examples/support-ticket-triage/`, and compare their metrics with
`maatml runs examples/support-ticket-triage/ --compare`.

This is still a rehearsal, not a trained model: the example ships 8 seed rows
and `training.max_steps: 4`, enough to prove the pipeline offline and in CI. A
real run needs a real corpus (`maatml datagen` or `maatml ingest`), then
`max_steps: -1` and a few epochs in `model.yml`.

## 5. Evaluate against the gates

```bash
maatml evaluate examples/support-ticket-triage/ --gate
```

`--gate` exits non-zero if `evaluation.gates` in `model.yml` aren't met, the
same check you'd wire into CI. **Expect it to fail here**: four steps on eight
samples does not earn `json_parse_rate: 0.95`, and a gate that passed on that
evidence would not be worth wiring into CI. That failure is the contract
working. Drop `--gate` to see the scores on their own, and re-run it once the
corpus and training budget are real.

## 6. Serve it

```bash
maatml serve examples/support-ticket-triage/
```

In another terminal:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/predict \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"request": "Cannot log in since this morning, urgent, paying customer"}' | jq
```

Add `?validate=1` to the URL to also run the task's validator inline on the
response.

## What just happened

One `model.yml` drove every stage above (prepare, train, evaluate, serve) through the same CLI. See [the validator-gated lifecycle](lifecycle.md) for why
that matters, and the [plugin author guide](plugins.md) for how to point this
at your own task instead of support-ticket triage.

## Next steps

- Browse the [other five examples](examples/index.md): vision, a
  vLLM-servable vision-language model, and two mainframe-log models share this
  same folder layout.
- Scaffold your own task:
  `maatml scaffold ~/models/my-task --architecture causal_sft --name my-task`.
- `maatml --help` and `maatml <command> --help` document every flag.
